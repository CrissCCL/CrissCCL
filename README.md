🎓 Electronics engineer specialized in **control systems, industrial automation, instrumentation, and embedded firmware**.

My work focuses on the **design, implementation, and validation of real engineering systems** — combining control theory, signal processing, hardware design, and practical constraints to deliver robust solutions for laboratory and industrial environments.

This GitHub serves as an **engineering portfolio**, hosting open technical repositories, hardware designs, and reference implementations used in control, instrumentation, and embedded development.
