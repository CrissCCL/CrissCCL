## 📂 About This GitHub

Most repositories here provide:
- Reference implementations
- Hardware and software project structures
- Supporting material for larger technical analyses

They are intended as **starting points, templates, and technical references**.

> Detailed design rationale, comparative studies, and fully reproducible analyses  
> are developed separately as **member-supported technical content**.
