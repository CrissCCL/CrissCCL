# 👋 Hi, I’m Cristian

**CrissCCL – applied control systems, digital signal processing, and embedded systems**

🎓 Electronics engineer focused on **control systems, automation, and embedded systems**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **system behavior, practical engineering decisions, and implementation constraints**.

This GitHub hosts **open technical repositories** and reference implementations that support my work in control, signal processing, and embedded development.
