# 👋 Hi, I’m Cristian

🎓 Electronics engineer with a strong focus on **control systems, automation, and embedded systems**.  
I work at the intersection of **practical engineering, system behavior, and implementation constraints**.

This GitHub hosts **open technical repositories**, reference implementations, and project structures
that support my work in control, signal processing, and embedded development.
